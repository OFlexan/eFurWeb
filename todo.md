# ToDo
- Add "Tap to view full" in pages `new.template.storyBody`
- ~~Add back arrow button when viewing comments (make sure it's only when you come from the "New" page) and add ~ after it to use cache~~
- Check for `null` in deleted comment texts
- ~~Maybe fix resolution for images (add max height and borders)~~
- Add an indicator so people know there are comments under the post (like a down arrow button/gradient overlay)
