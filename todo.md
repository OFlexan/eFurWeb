# ToDo
- ~~Add "Tap to view full" in pages `new.template.storyBody`~~
- ~~Add back arrow button when viewing comments (make sure it's only when you come from the "New" page) and add ~ after it to use cache~~
- ~~Check for `null` in deleted comment texts~~
- ~~Maybe fix resolution for images (add max height and borders)~~
- ~~Add an indicator so people know there are comments under the post (like a down arrow button/gradient overlay)~~
- Make the heart and favorite count stay when switching between pages using cache (not fixing for now, don't care)
- Add icons to drawer (not adding)
- Make mentions like @Dog in posts actually clickable (adding in future update)
- ~~Fix NSFW button showing for <18~~
- Add post editing (adding in future update)
- Add little badge next to post if it's hidden (adding in future update)
- Add following for profiles (adding in future update)
- Add counter next to drawer items `Following - 52` and make it reset when you click it (adding sometime in the future)
